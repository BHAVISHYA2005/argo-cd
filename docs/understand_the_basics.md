## Learn The Fundamentals

* Go through the online Docker and Kubernetes tutorials:
	* [A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b)
	* [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes)
	* [Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/)
* Depending on how you plan to template your applications:
    * [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) 
    * [Helm](https://helm.sh)
* If you're integrating with a CI tool:
	* [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
	* [Jenkins User Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/)

# Argo CD Contribution Guide

## Explore the Project Structure
In VS Code, take a look at the structure of the project. Some key folders/files to check:

- **`cmd/`**: Contains the main entry points for the various Argo CD commands/tools.
- **`pkg/`**: Contains reusable packages used throughout the project.
- **`manifests/`**: Kubernetes manifests for deploying Argo CD.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation files explaining various components.
- **`README.md`**: Overview of the project, including setup and usage instructions.

## Run the Project Locally
To understand how the project works, you can run it locally:

### Install Dependencies
Argo CD is written in Go, so you'll need Go installed (version 1.19 or later). Install it if you haven't already:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang
```

### Run the Project
Run the following command to start the Argo CD CLI tool:
```bash
go run ./cmd/argocd
```
This will start the Argo CD CLI tool. You'll need Kubernetes access to test its functionality.

---

## Read Key Documentation
Look for documentation within the **`docs/`** folder or online in the [Argo CD GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/wiki). This will help you understand the architecture and functionality of the project.

---

## Debug or Add Logs (Optional)
To see how specific parts of the code work, you can add `fmt.Println()` statements in the relevant parts of the codebase and re-run the project.

---

## Search for Specific Functionality
Use VS Code's global search feature (`Ctrl+Shift+F` or `Cmd+Shift+F`) to find specific functions, keywords, or concepts (e.g., **sync**, **manifest**, **controller**).

---

## Start Contributing
Once you're comfortable navigating the codebase, look for issues tagged as **"good first issue"** in the [Argo CD GitHub Issues](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues). These are beginner-friendly tasks to help you get started.
